  <center> <p3> Unfortunately, many giraffes attract high traffic for poachers and are hunted for their hides, horns, bones, tails, and meat. Becuase of this, giraffes are “vulnerable,” meaning they face a high risk of extinction in the wild.  </p3> </center>
   
   <center> <h2>10 Interesting Facts about Giraffes</h2> </center>

<ol>
  <li>Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller than many humans—about 6 feet</li>
  <li>They can run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances</li>
  <li>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water</li>
  <li>Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat</li>
  <li>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up</li>
  <li>The giraffe calf can stand up and walk after about an hour and within a week, it starts to sample vegetation</li>
  <li>A giraffe’s spots are much like human fingerprints. No two individual giraffes have exactly the same pattern</li>
  <li>Both male and female giraffes have two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use their horns to sometimes fight with other males</li>
  <li>Giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a time</li>
  <li>Whilst it was thought that giraffes did not make any sounds, this is now known to be untrue, as giraffes bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds, as well as low pitch noises beyond the range of human hearing</li>
